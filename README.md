# Installation

> [!WARNING]
> 1. As I don't have a paid Apple Developer account, this app is signed with a **development** certificate and not **notarized** by Apple.
> 
>    Due to the macOS security policy ([Safely open apps on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445)), you may need to do some extra steps to install and open the app.
> 
> 2. You just need to do the above steps **once**. After that, you can open the app from the `Launchpad` <img src="./docs/assets/launchpad.jpg.webp" alt="launchpad icon" width="20px"> as usual.
>
>    The app can be updated automatically, but you will never see the above warning again unless you reinstall the app.
>
> 3. If you have any concerns about the security of this app, you can:
>    - Check the source code and build the app by yourself.
>    - Use the Python version I developed: [Waker](https://github.com/ChenglongMa/waker). Their core functionality is the same, just the user interface is slightly different.
