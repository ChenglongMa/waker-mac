# Installation

> [!WARNING]
> 1. As I don't have a paid Apple Developer account, this app is signed with a **development** certificate and not **notarized** by Apple, see more at [Safely open apps on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445).
> 2. You may encounter additional installation steps due to macOS security policies.
> 3. Once installed, you can update the app automatically without encountering this warning again, unless you reinstall it.
> 4. If you have any concerns about the security of this app, you can:
>    - Check the source code and build the app by yourself.
>    - Use the Python version I developed: [Waker](https://github.com/ChenglongMa/waker). Their core functionality is
       the same, just the user interface is slightly different.
